        Hi! My name is Ã‰ric Segovia and I'm a video game developer from Spain, primarily focused on the <strong>design</strong> side of development.<br/>
        While my main interest lies in game design, especially combat and level design, I also enjoy the programming aspects of video games, although I'm lacking in this aspect.

      <div style="margin-top: 20px;"> You can see the <router-link to="/game-projects">videogames I worked in</router-link>, and <router-link to="/other-projects">other design projects</router-link>, which aren't videogames.</div>

      <div style="margin-top: 40px;">Aside from video games, I am also passionate about martial arts, specifically judo, in which I achieved the rank of black belt, and board games, primarily tabletop roleplaying games, as they allow me to create stories with other people in an immersive way.</div>
