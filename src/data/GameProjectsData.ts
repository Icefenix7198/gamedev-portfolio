     I worked as one of the main level designers participating in the creation of 4 of the 7 levels of the game, specially on the last level using the 3 shapes. I also worked on the development of some mechanics as the areas that forbid players movements but not corpses

In the game you will need to avoid being attacked by Animatronics by doing specific things like changing the TV channel when publicity kicks on or move to the blind spot of the door.
        <br/><br/>
        For this project I designed and programmed the mechanics from Freddy wwhere you need to return the plushies to the shelf they come from or suffer different negative effects, the last one being losing the usage of the flashligth, needed to stop the attack of another animatronic. I also designed all the timings in the 3 different game difficulties to ensure that never to animatronics that require quick action succeded at the same moment making the game unfair.
